Comment: OGRE (www.ogre3d.org) is made available under the MIT License,
 relicensed from LGPL-2.1+ since version 1.7 [1] [2].  There are many other
 copyright holders when looking at the headers of the source code files, and
 some files are released under different licenses.  It is unclear, however, if
 the relicensing of the project as a whole prevails over the individual
 information of those files w.r.t. licensing (since the re-licensing is
 posterior, of higher level and it does not mention anywhere "look at file
 headers for exceptions").  Many of these issues were described previously in
 great detail in this file, but they were removed because the information was
 very out-of-date.  Please refer to the headers of the files for more details.
