Description: 3D Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine (development files)
 OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible
 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for
 developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D
 graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying
 system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on
 world objects and other intuitive classes.
 .
 This package contains the headers needed to develop with OGRE.
